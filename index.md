I am a final year Ph.D student at Distributed Systems Lab, TU Darmstadt which is headed by [Prof. Patrick Eugster](https://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/eugstp/). My research is focussed on embedded device security. 

## Research Interests

- Securing low-end embedded IoT devices 
- Program anomaly detection 
- Machine learning and deep learning algorithms
- WSN communication and MAC layer protocols
- Remote attestation for verifying embedded device integrity
